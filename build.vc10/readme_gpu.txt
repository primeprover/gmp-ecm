
This is an initial build for the ECM GPU code using Visual Studio 2010, 
Parallel Nsight 2.1 and the CUDA 4.1 Toolkit.

To use it you will need to be familiar with setting Visual Studio project
properties since you will need to set the build configuration for your 
host OS (win32/x64) and for your GPU card (or cards). 

The Visual Studio solution is opened with the file ecm.cuda.sln 

By default it is set up to build for GPUs with 1.3 capabilities.  

Use at your own risk!
