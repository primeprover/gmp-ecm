1. How to compile GPU_ECM?

Open the Makefile and change (if necessary) the values of the following
variables:
  -GMP_PATH
  -CUDA_PATH
  -CC_BIN
  -USE_THIS_CC 
  -COMPUTE_CAPABILITY
  -mOPTION

Then save your Makefile and simply type 
make
to compile GPU-ECM.
Please report problems to Cyril.Bouvier@loria.fr



2. How to use GPU_ECM?
Type 
./gpu_ecm --help 
to print the following help:

Usage: gpu_ecm [options] B1 < file

Parameters:
  B1         stage 1 bound

Options:
  -n n       compute on n curves in parallel
  -d n       compute on device n
  -s d       compute for invd from d to d+number_of_curves 
  -save file save residues at end of stage 1 in file ( - means stdout )
  -v         verbose
  -vv        very verbose
  -h, --help prints this help and exit


The input file is read with the same functions as in GMP-ECM.


3. check.sh

check.sh is a shell program that checks that the output of GPU-ECM is correct.

Its usage is:
./check.sh [B1=1024 [n=0 [s=424242]]]
where B1, n and s correspond to the option of GPU-ECM.


Please report to Cyril.Bouvier@loria.fr any problems, bugs, ...
