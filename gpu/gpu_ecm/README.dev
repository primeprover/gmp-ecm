GPU-ECM is organized as follow:
  -def.h: contains 
  -main.c: read options and input files, initialize variables, do the
           precomputations and call the cuda_Main function in cudakernel.cu
  -utils.c and utils.h: Usefull C functions.
  -cudakernel.cu and cudakernel.h: the actual Cuda code for the GPU.

C files are compiled with gcc and Cuda files with nvcc (see Makefile)


check.sh is a shell program that checks that the output of GPU-ECM is correct.

Its usage is:
./check.sh [B1=1024 [n=0 [s=424242]]]
where B1, n and s correspond to the option of GPU-ECM.
